# Usage:
# 
#   $ prod-unreleased user sha
#
# Display links to Sifter tickets that "user" has worked on since "sha".  This
# is really useful if you have a bunch of tickets that are near release and
# want to double check everything before the release.
#
# The sha should be whatever is currently deployed in production.  User is your
# git name.
#
# Example:
#
#   $ git checkout production
#   $ ./prod-unreleased honza 6947fd9b7d5a6216d3a56e31b16370b8dbcfb93e
